# PyGSettingUtils

It is a python library plus a command-line utility for Gio.Settings. It makes it possible to write your settings inside a single file and not to worry about binding Widgets to setttings or having to write gschema.xml files.

**Note:** It is in very easrly stage of develpment and mostly not implemented.
